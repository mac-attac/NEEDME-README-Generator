# NEEDME.md - A Good README Generator

## Description

This project was created in order to be more efficient and consistent in README creation. As I create more and more projects, the need to save time generating a proper README made this project necessary. My hope is that in doing this, those using this project will be able to spend more time coding and less time creating the READMEs to describe project repositories.

## Installation

After an initial forking of the repository, open the application in VS Code. From here we need to install the JSON packages and inquirer module needed to run the application. In order to get our package.JSON files, run "npm init -y" at the command line. After, we can run "npm i inquirer" to ensure that our inquirer module is installed as well. You will know that both are installed when you see the corresponding "package.json", "package-lock.json", and "node_modules" files in your current working directory. From there we just need to run "node index.js", or whatever your main JS file is in the working directory, for the prompts to run in the terminal. After entering in all relevant data for your README, a README.md file will generate with your custom input.

## Usage
